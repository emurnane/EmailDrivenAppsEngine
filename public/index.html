						<p>How to Play: <br> 
You are the ship, and your goal is to defend yourself from the oncoming enemy ships that will appear as the day progresses (as the sun moves across the sky and the hours on the clock in the [top left corner of the screen] tick by). <br>

The number of enemy ships corresponds to the number of emails you receive at that time of day, and the number of bullets you have to fire at those ships corresponds to the number of emails you send at that time of day.<br>

You start with 3 lives — you can see how many you have left in the upper right hand corner. You gain XX points for each enemy you destroy and Y points for each “hour” you stay alive, and you level up at the end of each “day”. Try to survive as long as possible! If the game ends — either because you win or lose — feel free to restart and replay it as many times as you like.</p>
