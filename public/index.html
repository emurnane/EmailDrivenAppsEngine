			<h1>How to Play: </h1> 
			<p>You are the ship, and your goal is to defend yourself from the oncoming enemy ships that will appear as the day progresses (i.e., as the hours of the day go by — see "Current Wave" in the top right corner of the screen).</p>
                	<p>Use the up and down arrow keys to move your ship and the left and right arrow keys to rotate your ship. Fire bullets using the XX key to destroy enemy ships and gain points — the bigger or faster the enemy ship, the more points you'll gain for destroying it. (Small ships = +XX points, medium ships = +YY points, big ships = +XX points). Your current number of points are shown in the upper left corner of the screen.</p>
                	<p>If you find yourself without any bullets to fire at enemies, you will just have to dodge them! Hitting an enemy will inflict damage upon you — the bigger or faster the enemy, the more points you'll lose. (Small ships = -XX points, medium ships = -xx points, large ships = -xx points).</p>
                	<p>The number of enemy ships that appear during a wave correspond to the number of emails you receive at that time of day. The number of bullets you have to fire at those ships corresponds to the number of emails you send at that time of day. Enemy attributes represent characteristics of that email:</p>
               		<ul>
                    		<li>Enemy Color: Domain of sender's email address (Red = Cornell; Blue = Non-Cornell academic (xxx@yyy.edu); Green = Gmail, Hotmail, or Yahoo; Gray: Other domains).</li>
                    		<li>Enemy Size: Length of that received email.</li>
                    		<li>Enemy Speed: Number of recipients of that received email (enemy is fastest if you are the only recipient and gets slower the higher the number of other recipients).</li>
                	</ul>
                	<p>Try to survive as long as possible! If the game ends — either because you win or lose — feel free to restart and replay it as many times as you like.</p>
